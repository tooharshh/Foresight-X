A collection of my lab projects and research work on earthquake early warning systems. The repository includes projects code, data analysis, and research experiments for earthquake prediction.

## **Papers**

1. A Critical Review on Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Seismic Risk Mitigation: A Machine Learning Approach
   - **Accepted for chapter publication in LNCE, Springer**
  
## **Projects**

1. Prediction of Earthquake magnitudes through a Random Forest regression model
   - **Achieved a R² score = 0.83 with RMSE of 0.51 magnitude units.**
   - **Identified and resolved data leakage from the 'significance' feature (0.957 correlation)**
   - **Reduced overfitting (R² = 0.9996) using regularization techniques(max depth limiting, minimum sample constraints).**
   - **Decreaed the train-test performance gap from 14.6% to 0.4% .**
