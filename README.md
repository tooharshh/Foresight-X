A collection of my lab projects and research work on earthquake early warning systems. The repository includes projects code, data analysis, and research experiments for earthquake prediction.

## **Projects**

1. Random Forest regression model to predict earthquake magnitudes using seismic data, achieving an R² score of 0.83 with RMSE of 0.51 magnitude units.
   - **Identified and resolved data leakage from the 'significance' feature (0.957 correlation), transitioning from overfitting (R² = 0.9996) to realistic accuracy using seismic features (depth, location, tsunami occurrence).**
   - **Implemented regularization techniques (max depth limiting, minimum sample constraints) to reduce overfitting, decreasing the train-test performance gap from 14.6% to an acceptable level while maintaining model generalizability.**
